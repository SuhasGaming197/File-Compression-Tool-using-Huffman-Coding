# File-Compression-Tool-using-Huffman-Coding
A file compression utility developed in C++ that implements the Huffman coding algorithm to reduce file size efficiently. The project leverages a min-heap (std::priority_queue) to prioritize and extract characters based on their frequency, ensuring optimal prefix codes are generated for maximum compression ratios.
